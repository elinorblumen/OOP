~ IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES ~

Locker:
Ive chosen to store the information in a map as there's
No order for the items. And I kept all the constraints
Pairs in another array.

Long term Storage: 
I chose to store all the information in a map as well, the only
Difference is that I didn't have to keep the constraints pairs,

Data sets use:
I chose the empty data set to ensure that when there are no hotels in a given
city an empty array is returned.
I chose the the data set just one city for the test that didn't require multiple cities.

Compare By Rating:
I implemented by Comperator interface, I implemented the compare method in
such a way that if two hotels had the same rating they were compared by
Their alphabet order.

Compare by location:
I implemented by Comperator interface, I implemented the compare method in
such a way that if two hotels had the same distance they were compared by
Their points of interest.
